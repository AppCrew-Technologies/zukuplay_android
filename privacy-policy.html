        <strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 2025<br>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 2025

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p><span class="app-name">Zukuplay</span> ("Our", "We" or "Us") respects your privacy and is dedicated to protecting the privacy of those persons using ("User(s)" or "You") Zukuplay products, services and applications. This Privacy Policy helps You to understand what personal information/data ("Personal Information") and non-personal information We collect, and how We use it.</p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to personal information submitted and collected through the Services. By installing, using, registering to or otherwise accessing the Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not install, use, register to or otherwise access the Services. Zukuplay reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. Your continued use of the Services will signify your acceptance to the changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
        
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>data on how the user uses our Services;</li>
            <li>aggregate data on content the user engages with.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We may use this information to personalize and improve our services, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. We may provide this information to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>

        <h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
        <p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Non-Personal Information" means information that does not directly identify you. Zukuplay may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain Non-Personal Information that does not directly enable Zukuplay to identify you. The types of Non-Personal Information Zukuplay may collect and use include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Basic Service Set Identifier, Service Set Identifier, unique device identifier or other persistent or non-persistent device identifier ("Device ID");</li>
            <li>device software platform and firmware;</li>
            <li>mobile phone carrier;</li>
            <li>image, audio or video files (uploaded by users with consent in the feedback module);</li>
            <li>other Non-Personal Information as reasonably required by Zukuplay to enhance the Services and other Zukuplay products and services;</li>
            <li>Cookies. Zukuplay treats information collected by cookies and similar technologies as non-personal information. A "cookie" is a small bit of record-keeping information that sites often store on a user's computer. Cookies do not include people's names, email addresses, or other information that is personally identifiable; they are typically used to quickly identify a user's computer and to "remember" things about the user's visit. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Zukuplay is built with your privacy as our top priority. We do NOT collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Browsing history or search queries</li>
                <li>Social media information</li>
                <li>Payment information</li>
                <li>Any data that could identify you personally</li>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. DISCLOSING AND HOSTING INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>We may share your personal information in the following circumstances.</p>
        
        <p>We will share your information with the following selected third parties:</p>
        
        <p>We may disclose and transfer your personal information to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of our Apps or Services, or in connection with a contemplated or agreed upon merger, acquisition, consolidation, restructuring, or the sale of substantially all our interests and/or assets (i.e., a bankruptcy proceeding). We shall require the subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator in possession of your personal information to continue to be subject to this Privacy Policy; otherwise, we shall request that they provide any necessary notice and/or obtain consent from you.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. COLLECTION AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>The Services comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Zukuplay does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through the Services. In addition, in the event that a user identifies himself or herself as a child under the age of 13 within the Services or in connection with any Content or Software, Zukuplay will not collect, store or use any personal information of such user. Further, in the event that Zukuplay receives personal information that Zukuplay discovers was provided by a child under the age of 13, Zukuplay will promptly delete such personal information in a secure manner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. SAFEGUARDS</h2>
        <p>Zukuplay maintains appropriate safeguards that ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal information we collect and store about our account holders, including children under 13. Personal information collected by Zukuplay is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public and that are only accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control (i.e., maintain data quality).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES OR SERVICES</h2>
        <p>You should be aware that the Services may from time to time contain links to third-party sites, products or services. Zukuplay is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites or services. If you are concerned about the privacy policy of a certain third party, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the site or service to which you link before you submit any personal information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. GOOGLE USER DATA (ZUKUPLAY - iOS/ANDROID)</h2>
        <p>In order for the application to be able to play, download and upload video, audio files on Google Drive, you need to grant the application access to Google Drive files. Application access to files is limited to certain audio type file extensions (mp3, mp4, flac, etc.).</p>
        
        <p>When you connect Google Drive within the application, we will use the Google Drive API and access some user data from your Google profile and/or Google Account Identifier ("account Id").</p>
        
        <p>"Zukuplay" use and transfer of information received from Google APIs to any other app will adhere to Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>1) Accessing Google User Data</h3>
        <p>Zukuplay accesses Google resources from the device where you use Zukuplay. Your device communicates directly with the Google APIs.</p>
        <p>Zukuplay sends users to https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth for authorization and does not directly access or collect user data used by Google Auth.</p>
        
        <h3>2) Using Google User Data</h3>
        <p>Zukuplay includes functions that you can execute in order to read or modify your own data (or data shared with you). This can only happen after you provide a token, which requires that you authenticate yourself as a specific Google user and authorize these actions.</p>
        
        <h3>3) Collecting Google User Data</h3>
        <p>userinfo.email (view your email address), userinfo.profile (see your personal info. including any personal info you've made publicly available), and openid (authenticate using OpenID Connect) are required to be used by Google Auth.</p>
        <p>Zukuplay allows you to manage your Google Drive files and therefore the default scopes also include drive (read/write access to your Google Drive) and drive.appdata (manage configuration folder in your Google Drive).</p>
        <p>However, Zukuplay never receives your data or the permission to access your data in your Google Drive account. The owners of the project can only see anonymous, aggregated information about usage of tokens obtained through its OAuth client, such as which APIs and endpoints are being used.</p>
        
        <h3>4) Sharing Google User Data</h3>
        <p>Zukuplay only communicates with Google APIs. No user data is shared with the owners of Zukuplay, or any other party.</p>
        
        <p class="notice">Notice: If you experience a crash while using Zukuplay, the crash report sent to our servers may contain some information about the operating system you are using.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>Zukuplay may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and at Zukuplay's sole discretion. All changes hereto will be made available on this website, which is why Zukuplay encourages Users to frequently check this page for any changes to this Privacy Policy. Changes hereto will not prejudice Users' rights without their consent.</p>
